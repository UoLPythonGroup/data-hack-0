Some notes on the "pythonGeoHack" directory...
Useful to read in conjunction with Jitse's IPython notebook.

leedsALL.xxx:
   Jitse says these all together form a shapefile specification, namely various bits
   of geometry.

leedsTags.csv:
   CSV table, with columns:
   unnamed: ???
   id: Corresponds to the "records" in the shapefile.  Can also look up using OpenStreet Map,
      e.g. http://www.openstreetmap.org/way/1628965
      this shows a segment of Pudsey Road
   highway: Type of highway
   cycleway: "NA", or type of cyclepath
   access: not sure what this means; the example above is "no", but it's just a normal
      residential street
      Should be: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Key:access?uselang=en-US
      which says "access as in legal right of way", but this is clearly _not_ reflected in
      the data!
   foot: is there a footpath? (Again, wrong in places).
   bicycle: accessible to a bike?
   oneway: as it suggests
   routeId: See below  (mostly 0, only 11 other options)
   routingFactorId: Some number between 2 and 657; _think_ looks to mwayRF.csv


mwayBR.csv:
   CSV table, with columns:
   unnamed: ??? Just counts up sequentially
   id: a "relation" id in OpenStreet Map:
      http://www.openstreetmap.org/relation/3103492
   originalTags: tab separated data
   name: Name of the route
   network: type of the network ("lcn", "rcn", etc.)
   cnRef: ???
   sumLengthsKm: Total length?
   rating: "continuous", "touring" etc.
   
   So these seem to be large-scale cycle networks, or collections of paths in a forest,
   around a lake etc.  As Jitse noticed, the "routeId" from leedsTags.csv seems to correspond
   to the "id" here, though rather few entries have a routeId.  Thus this file seems to be of
   limited use.


mwayRF.csv:
   CSV table, with columns:
   unnamed: ??? Just counts up sequentially
   id: same as unnamed
   color: Hex RGB triple in format #rrggbb ??
   cyclable: no/yes
   walkable: no/yes
   speed: average(??) speed in mph?
   quietness: ?? 1-100 scale seemingly
   pause: time in seconds to deal with obstacles.
   rfHash: apparently purely internal number.
   Got info on these from the README.txt file.

   I believe these are a lookup table from the routingFactorId column in leedsTags.
   I wrote a little IPython notebook to check, and the cyclable and walkable fields do match
   (except for when the data is missing from leedsTags when it seems a bit random).



leedsOSMTags.csv:
   CSV table, with columns:
   unnamed: ???
   id: corresponds to the "id" field in leedsTags.csv
   k: key
   v: value
   So lots of key,value pairs, apparently directly from OpenStreetMap.  Contains some
   extra data, such a "name", "ref" (e.g. A,B road number), "maxspeed" etc.
